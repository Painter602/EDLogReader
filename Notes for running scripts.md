# Notes for running EDLogReader as a Python script
## Why not distribute an executable version?
I do, check the releases ( https://github.com/Painter602/EDLogReader/releases )

## If you prefer to use the source files
- The script was written in Python 3.9 and has been tested with Python 3.8,

## Required:
Same as on the README page ( https://github.com/Painter602/EDLogReader/blob/main/README.md )
  
#### Nice to have:
The script can run from the command line or from Python's IDLE.  The Python environment can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/

I built an executable from my copy using a Python compiler.

There are several Python compilers out there. Pyinstaller seems to work well, but I suggest you research available options, and select the one best suited to you.

## After uploading
Same as on the README page ( https://github.com/Painter602/EDLogReader/blob/main/README.md )
